<h3> Third Day Progress </h3>
<div> 
The problem from yesterday that I've spent two hours in the afternoon has been solved by making a new folder called "Downloads" and copy pasting a blocks.xnb file.
the solution is simple and I'm mad that this worked......
</div> 
<p> edit 1 </p>
</br>
<div>
The making of the player camera has worked with minimal errors and the only minor problem was finding the position of my player to make the camera follow that
it has be solved grabing the rectangle of the player and the location and making it ToVector2.
</div>
<p> edit 2 </p>
<div>
10:31 time to start the moving functions to only work for one key press. </br>
Was simple, done in about 20 minutes all I had to do was make a function for when keys A and D were up as well as the bool was in a certain condition
then the function would change the bools condition.
</div>
<p> edit 3 </p>
<div>
Now its time to make collisions for my tiled and player. </br>
This is difficult. </br>
Hasn't worked 
</div>
<p> edit 4 </p>

<div>
Trying to spawn the player on the tile map by either shifting the map or moving the player. </br>
None of these are working and my camera is tracking my player which I don't want it to do.
Finally got it to work after an hour.
</div>
<p> edit 5</p>

<div>
Going to remake all of my collision code and hopefully intersects works better than making AABB code.
